            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how TalkRizz collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Since we do not store personal data, your primary concern should be with your own account security.</p>

            <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
